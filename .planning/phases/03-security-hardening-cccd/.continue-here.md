<current_state>
Phase 3 directory just created. `/gsd:plan-phase 3` was invoked, init + validate + mkdir done.
Research, planning, and verification have NOT started yet.
Phase 1 (BHXH) and Phase 2 (Digital Signature) are fully complete (all 4 plans each executed).
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phase 3 directory created: `.planning/phases/03-security-hardening-cccd/`
- Phase validated against roadmap (found=true, 5 requirements: SEC-01..05)
- Prior session: Prescription.tsx + Laboratory.tsx signing integration committed + pushed (23dd637)

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Research Phase 3 (spawn gsd-phase-researcher)
- Plan Phase 3 (spawn gsd-planner) — generate PLAN.md files
- Verify plans (spawn gsd-plan-checker)
- Execute all plans

Key note: SEC-05 (CCCD validation) is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED (Session 18, commit 01fc52b):
  - Backend: CccdValidator.cs with 51 province codes
  - Backend: GET /api/reception/validate-cccd endpoint
  - Frontend: validation rules in Reception.tsx
  So Phase 3 planning should mark SEC-05 as pre-existing and focus on SEC-01..04.

SEC-01: Access control matrix documentation (Decree 85/2016)
SEC-02: Data encryption at rest for sensitive patient data
SEC-03: Backup and recovery procedures documented and tested
SEC-04: Security incident response plan
SEC-05: CCCD/National ID validation — ALREADY DONE

Audit logging system also already exists (AuditLogMiddleware, AuditLogService, AuditController, SystemAdmin UI tab).

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Phase 3 is next per roadmap dependency graph (depends on Phase 1+2, both complete)
- SEC-05 already implemented — planner should acknowledge and skip
- Audit logging already exists — can be leveraged for SEC-01 compliance reporting
- Phase 3 is mostly documentation + config, less code than Phase 1-2

</decisions_made>

<context>
User requested to continue all remaining phases in the roadmap.
Phase 3 was selected as next (Security Hardening + CCCD).
The /gsd:plan-phase 3 workflow was started but context ran out after
init + validate + mkdir. The full workflow needs: research -> plan -> verify -> execute.

GSD config from init:
- researcher_model: inherit
- planner_model: inherit
- checker_model: sonnet
- research_enabled: true
- plan_checker_enabled: true
- commit_docs: true
</context>

<next_action>
Run `/gsd:plan-phase 3` in a fresh conversation. The directory exists but has no
RESEARCH.md, CONTEXT.md, or PLAN.md files yet. The workflow will detect this and
start from research.
</next_action>
